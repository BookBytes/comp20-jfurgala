## Purpose
To showcase what I have done and learned in Comp20

## Favorite assignment/lab
Of the labs, I most enjoyed the responsive design lab. Before I was not aware that you could tailor a webpage based on the side of the window (not the screen). It opens up a lot of options for customizing a webpage with not just formatting but also content. The lab example reminded me of having a digital flipbook.

## Growth
Looking back I see two forms of growth throughout this semester. One is the new knowledge of putting names and examples to concepts and code I had written before without full awareness of what was going on in the background (e.g. the Google enter example). Before Comp20 I lacked some of the formal technical terminology to explain what I was working with. 

The other form of growth was noticeable assignment-by-assigment (or lab-by-lab). Each task I completed gave me a firmer grasp of the big ideas and a glimpse into the fascinating capabilities of the tech we were working with. 

I also gained experience working with a framework other than flask, which allowed me to compare prior experiences and opportunities each framework offers.

## Most important thing learned

As a result of my Comp20 experience I learned standards such as HTML5 and the recommended ways to drive web development as I was formerly mixing concerns (formatting and content). For example on assignment 2, I split my work into a file for the webpage content itself (index.html), a page for my JS map logic (map.js), and a page for my page formatting (style.css).

One thing I could do better in this example is to move the images into an img folder or store them somewhere externally.

You'll see I stored my images together in a folder for my assignment 4:

## Future exploration

I would like to explore more about the security vulnerabilities in many web apps and the implications that the sad state of most websites lacking proper security has on Internet use. Even seeing what we went over on a basic level in class, I was surprised and am definitely more wary of trusting websites with information (I already operated under the assumption that nothing was really private).
